Naming
------
Variable: lower camel case.

	domainName

Class: upper camel case
File name: upper camel case

	DatabaseConnector

Function argument:
An input parameter shall be 'const TYPE &'.

Standards & Libraries
---------------------
### Using
- STL
  * Containers such as list, vector and map.
  * String (We use UTF-8. So wstring is not used)
- GLib
  * Event loop
  * I/O functions associated with the event loop such as timer, idle, and GIOChannel.
- pthread
  * Actually features are wrapped by MLPL that is a part of Hatohol.

### Not using
- Boost
- C++11
However, we'll begin to use features of C++11 in near future. Probably it is
when we support CentOS7 (g++4.7) instead of CentOS6 (g++4.4) series.
Of course, we can now use features supported by g++4.4.

Others
------
- Don't use 'using namespace' in a header file.
- Use 'static const' instead of #define to define a constant.
- Don't return const object such as 'const string func()'.
NOTE: If a function returns a reference, this convention is not applied.
      E.g. 'const string &func()' is OK

- Add 'override' at the end of the function prototype as a comment when
  an override method is declared.

    virtual overriddenMetho(void) // override

This is a practice to specify that clearly.
Note: When we use C++11, we just remove '//'.

- Basically use Pimpl idiom
Many existing code have private members in the structure named PrivateContext,
which is defined in the source (.cc) file.
However, for classes that needs performance, definition of private members
in the heder file is allowed.

Python

Baisically follow PEP 8

Indent: 4 spaces
